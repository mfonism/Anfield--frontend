## Anfield

So, after three years of doing mostly back end work (and a brief stint as a UI/UX Engineer) I'm diving into the front end. I want to be as proficient in front end work as I am in back end.

Okay, so I've mastered HTML and CSS, and can find my way around JavaScript's syntax and nuances. But these days, frameworks are the rage. JS frameworks, I mean.

I've worked with Elm and PureScript, two Haskell-like frameworks that compile to JavaScript.

But most jobs are looking for Angular, React or Vue experience.

I'm going with Angular because I've read that _Angularville_ is just like _Pythonshire_ and _Djangotopia_, where there's **"one -- and preferably only one -- obvious way to do" things** -- yes, I meant to write it that way.

### What am I building?

A web app where I showcase the awesomeness of Liverpool FC, because trophies don't lie.

### Why am I building this?

I opted to do this instead of following a tutorial, as I want to build something I'm actually excited about.

And as I build it, I want to hone the habit of building things incrementally. I want to discover requirements for myself and tackle them in bits. And discover new things in AngularJS as I satisfy each requirement.

Lastly, I want to come out of this project with a refreshingly new path for anyone who is interested in learning AngularJS.

And, oh, lest I forget, the back end of this project is at https://github.com/mfonism/Anfield--backend and it's written in NodeJS...

...because I wanted to learn some new server-side technology!
